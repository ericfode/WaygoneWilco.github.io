## Prerequisites and installation

### Install Hugo 

You need a [recent **extended** version](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) (we recommend version 0.61 or later) of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to do local builds and previews of sites (like this one) that uses this theme.

If you install from the release page, make sure to get the `extended` Hugo version, which supports [sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html); you may need to scroll down the list of releases to see it. 

For comprehensive Hugo documentation, see [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/).
